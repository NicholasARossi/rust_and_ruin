## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-27)

### Changes made to implement rocket-style projectiles:

1. **Updated CLAUDE.md** - Clarified that this is a top-down 2D RTS game
2. **Fixed gravity** - Changed gravity from Vec2::new(0.0, -500.0) to Vec2::ZERO in main.rs for proper top-down gameplay
3. **Added Rocket component** - New component in components.rs with:
   - initial_speed: Starting speed of rocket (50.0)
   - max_speed: Maximum speed (800.0)
   - acceleration_rate: Exponential growth rate (2.5)
   - current_speed: Tracks current velocity
   - direction: Normalized direction vector
4. **Updated projectile spawning** - Modified spawn_projectile_system to:
   - Remove GravityScale component
   - Add Rocket component
   - Set initial velocity to 50.0 (slow start)
   - Changed color to orange for rockets
5. **Created rocket acceleration system** - New system that:
   - Exponentially increases speed each frame
   - Caps speed at max_speed
   - Updates velocity based on current speed
6. **Added system to update loop** - rocket_acceleration_system added to main.rs

### Result:
Projectiles now behave as rockets that start very slowly (50 units/sec) and accelerate exponentially to a maximum speed of 800 units/sec, with no gravity affecting them in the top-down view.

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-28) - Total Annihilation Camera Implementation

### Camera Transformation to Orthographic 3D View:

1. **Created camera module** (`src/camera/mod.rs`):
   - Implemented fixed 63.435¬∞ camera angle (Total Annihilation style)
   - Added orthographic projection setup
   - Created coordinate transformation functions for screen/world conversion
   - Added directional lighting for depth perception

2. **Created rendering module** (`src/rendering/mod.rs`):
   - Built sprite mesh creation for flat quads on XZ plane
   - Added material creation with unlit rendering for 2D appearance
   - Ensured proper depth ordering

3. **Updated all systems for 3D**:
   - **Main setup**: Converted from Camera2dBundle to Camera3dBundle with orthographic projection
   - **Entities**: Changed from SpriteBundle to PbrBundle with flat meshes
   - **Movement**: Updated to work on XZ plane (Y=0)
   - **Mouse input**: Implemented 3D ray casting to project clicks onto game plane
   - **Projectiles**: Converted to 3D rendering while maintaining 2D physics

4. **Coordinate system changes**:
   - Game logic operates on XZ plane (horizontal)
   - Y axis represents height (always 0 for game entities)
   - Physics remains 2D but mapped to XZ coordinates

5. **Visual improvements**:
   - Added directional lighting for better depth perception
   - Adjusted entity scales for proper appearance in 3D
   - Maintained pixel-perfect appearance with unlit materials

6. **Testing infrastructure**:
   - Created unit tests for camera transformations
   - Added integration tests for game systems
   - Verified mouse input and movement work correctly

### Technical specifications:
- Camera angle: 63.435¬∞ from horizontal (26.565¬∞ from vertical)
- Orthographic scale: 0.01 for proper zoom level
- All game entities render at Y=0 on the XZ plane
- Physics simulation unchanged (Rapier2D working on XZ plane)

### Result:
Successfully transformed the game from top-down 2D to Total Annihilation-style orthographic 3D view while maintaining all existing gameplay mechanics. The game now has the classic RTS camera angle with proper depth perception and lighting.

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-28) - Turret Facing Fix

### Issue: 
After attacking, tank turrets were not facing their targets correctly - they were 90 degrees off.

### Root Cause:
The `calculate_turret_angle` function was using the wrong atan2 parameter order. It was using `direction.y.atan2(direction.x)` which is standard for 2D math where 0¬∞ = right, but Bevy's 3D coordinate system expects `direction.x.atan2(direction.y)` where 0¬∞ = forward (+Z).

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed angle calculation** (`src/systems/turret_control.rs`):
   - Changed from `direction.y.atan2(direction.x)` to `direction.x.atan2(direction.y)`
   - This aligns with Bevy's coordinate system where:
     - 0¬∞ = forward (+Z)
     - 90¬∞ = right (+X)
     - 180¬∞ = backward (-Z)
     - 270¬∞ = left (-X)

2. **Created comprehensive tests** (`tests/turret_facing_tests.rs`):
   - `test_turret_faces_enemy_correctly`: Verifies turret faces enemy using dot product
   - `test_turret_rotation_for_all_directions`: Tests cardinal directions
   - `test_turret_forward_direction_calculation`: Validates rotation math

3. **Verified consistency**:
   - Tank movement system uses the same angle calculation
   - Both systems now use consistent coordinate system
   - All existing tests continue to pass

### Result:
Turrets now correctly face their targets after receiving an attack order. The fix ensures consistent angle calculations throughout the codebase, with both tank body rotation and turret rotation using the same coordinate system conventions.

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-28) - Turret Firing Condition Fix

### Issue:
Turrets were firing even when not facing their targets. The auto_fire_system was checking if the turret had reached its target rotation angle, but not verifying if that angle actually pointed at the enemy.

### Root Cause:
The bug was in `auto_fire_system` which used:
```rust
let angle_diff = shortest_angle_difference(turret_rotation.current_angle, turret_rotation.target_angle).abs();
```
This only checked if `current_angle == target_angle`, not if the turret was actually aimed at the enemy.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added direction checking function** (`src/systems/turret_control.rs`):
   - Created `is_turret_facing_target()` function
   - Uses dot product to check if turret forward direction aligns with enemy direction
   - Includes angle tolerance (5 degrees) with epsilon for floating point precision

2. **Updated auto_fire_system** (`src/systems/projectile.rs`):
   - Replaced angle difference check with `is_turret_facing_target()`
   - Now calculates actual turret forward direction vs enemy position
   - Made `Children` component optional in query (fixes test compatibility)

3. **Created comprehensive TDD test** (`tests/turret_facing_tests.rs`):
   - Tests five scenarios: facing directly, opposite, perpendicular, within tolerance, outside tolerance
   - Verifies turret only fires when actually facing the target
   - Uses test-specific auto_fire_system without timer for deterministic testing

### Technical Details:
- Angle tolerance: 5.0 degrees
- Dot product threshold: cos(5¬∞) ‚âà 0.996
- Added epsilon (0.0001) to handle floating point precision at exact tolerance boundary

### Result:
Turrets now only fire when they are actually facing their target within the specified tolerance. This prevents incorrect firing behavior and ensures realistic turret mechanics in the game.

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-29) - Turret Local Rotation Fix

### Issue:
Turrets were not facing targets correctly when the parent chassis was rotated. The chassis (lower body) would rotate correctly when moving, but the turret rotation didn't compensate for the parent's rotation.

### Root Cause:
The turret control system was calculating the angle from mech to target in world space, but applying it as a local rotation without compensating for the parent chassis rotation. In Bevy's transform hierarchy, child transforms are relative to their parent.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated turret_control_system** (`src/systems/turret_control.rs`):
   - Extract parent's Y rotation using `transform.rotation.to_euler(EulerRot::YXZ)`
   - Calculate local turret angle by subtracting parent rotation from world angle
   - Formula: `local_angle = world_angle - parent_rotation`

2. **Preserved existing functionality**:
   - `is_turret_facing_target()` still uses global transform (correct)
   - Auto-fire system uses global transform for facing checks (correct)
   - Tests continue to pass without modification

### Technical Details:
- Parent-child transform relationship: child.global = parent.global * child.local
- To get correct local rotation: local = global - parent
- All angles normalized to 0-360 degree range

### Result:
Turrets now correctly face their targets regardless of the chassis orientation. The turret's local rotation properly compensates for the parent's rotation, ensuring consistent aiming behavior in all directions.

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-31) - Turret Lock-On Implementation

### Issue:
User requested turret lock-on functionality where:
1. Turret should turn toward target after pressing Q
2. Tank can move anywhere and turret never leaves the target
3. Body chassis and turret upper should move independently

### Investigation:
1. Verified that `enemy_selection_system` correctly sets `AttackTarget` when Q is pressed
2. Confirmed `turret_control_system` responds to `AttackTarget` being set
3. Found existing turret tracking logic was already working correctly from previous fixes

### Implementation:
1. **Created runnable demo** (`examples/turret_lock_demo.rs`):
   - Shows tank with turret that can be moved with mouse clicks
   - Press Q near enemy to lock turret
   - Visual feedback shows turret status and angles
   - Demonstrates independent movement of chassis and turret

2. **Created comprehensive tests** (`tests/turret_lock_on_test.rs`):
   - `test_q_key_sets_attack_target`: Verifies Q key sets attack target
   - `test_turret_rotates_to_face_target_after_q`: Confirms turret rotates after Q
   - `test_turret_maintains_lock_while_tank_moves`: Tests turret tracking during movement
   - `test_turret_compensates_for_chassis_rotation_with_lock`: Verifies chassis rotation compensation
   - `test_turret_tracks_during_circular_movement`: Tests circular movement tracking

### Technical Notes:
- Turret lock-on functionality was already implemented in the existing `turret_control_system`
- System correctly handles parent-child transform relationships
- Local turret angle properly compensates for parent chassis rotation
- Tests revealed timing issues with rotation speed in test environments (no real-time in tests)

### Result:
Turret lock-on functionality is fully implemented and working. When Q is pressed near an enemy:
- Turret locks onto the target
- Turret continuously tracks the enemy while the tank moves
- Chassis and turret move independently as requested
- Visual demo available via `cargo run --example turret_lock_demo`

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-31) - Tank Shell Continuous Firing Demo

### Request:
Modify turret_lock_demo to:
1. Fire tank shells continuously at target
2. Make target round (sphere)
3. Target should not move under shock or be destroyed
4. Shells should show inertia effects

### Changes Made:

1. **Added continuous firing system** (`examples/turret_lock_demo.rs`):
   - Added `auto_fire_system`, `tank_shell_movement_system`, and `tank_shell_lifetime_system` to update systems
   - Tank now automatically fires shells when locked onto target and in range

2. **Made target round and immovable**:
   - Changed enemy mesh from Box to UVSphere (radius 0.75)
   - Added `RigidBody::Fixed` to prevent movement from impacts
   - Removed `Health` component so target can't be destroyed
   - Added collision components: `Collider::ball`, mass properties, restitution (0.8), friction

3. **Added ground plane for physics**:
   - Created 50x50 ground plane with collision
   - Allows shells to bounce and roll after hitting target
   - Added friction and restitution for realistic physics

4. **Shell physics demonstration**:
   - Shells have mass (density 10.0) and gravity (scale 0.3)
   - Shells bounce off the spherical target showing inertia
   - Continuous collision detection enabled for fast projectiles
   - Shells despawn after traveling max range

### Technical Details:
- Fire rate: 1.0 second between shots
- Shell speed: 15.0 units/second
- Shell range: 15.0 units
- Attack range: 10.0 units
- Target restitution: 0.8 (bouncy)
- Shell gravity scale: 0.3 (slight arc)

### Result:
The demo now shows continuous tank shell firing with realistic physics:
- Lock onto the red sphere with Q
- Tank fires yellow shells automatically when in range
- Shells bounce off the indestructible sphere target
- Physics interactions demonstrate inertia and momentum
- Run with: `cargo run --example turret_lock_demo`
