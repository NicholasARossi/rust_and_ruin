# Rust and Ruin - Development Tasks

## üéØ MVP Goal
A single Hero Mech smoothly moves to a clicked position, able to circle around a stationary Enemy Target. Hero Mech fires realistic physics-based projectiles toward the enemy on right-click.

- [ ] Test movement in all directions

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Projectile System
- [ ] Set up bevy_rapier2d physics world
- [ ] Create projectile spawning on right-click
- [ ] Calculate aim direction from Hero to Enemy
- [ ] Apply initial velocity to projectile
- [ ] Configure gravity for realistic arc
- [ ] Add projectile sprite/visual
- [ ] Implement projectile cleanup when off-screen
- [ ] Test various shooting angles

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Collision Detection
- [ ] Add collision shapes to Enemy and Projectiles
- [ ] Implement collision event handling

## üìù Notes

- Keep each step simple and functional
- Test frequently during development
- Commit working code after each completed step
- Document any issues or blockers
- Prioritize gameplay feel over visual polish for MVP

## üêõ Known Issues

- None yet

## üí° Ideas & Experiments

- Experiment with different physics parameters for projectiles
- Try different movement interpolation methods
- Consider adding prediction lines for projectile paths
- Test various input schemes for better game feel

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-27)

### Changes made to implement rocket-style projectiles:

1. **Updated CLAUDE.md** - Clarified that this is a top-down 2D RTS game
2. **Fixed gravity** - Changed gravity from Vec2::new(0.0, -500.0) to Vec2::ZERO in main.rs for proper top-down gameplay
3. **Added Rocket component** - New component in components.rs with:
   - initial_speed: Starting speed of rocket (50.0)
   - max_speed: Maximum speed (800.0)
   - acceleration_rate: Exponential growth rate (2.5)
   - current_speed: Tracks current velocity
   - direction: Normalized direction vector
4. **Updated projectile spawning** - Modified spawn_projectile_system to:
   - Remove GravityScale component
   - Add Rocket component
   - Set initial velocity to 50.0 (slow start)
   - Changed color to orange for rockets
5. **Created rocket acceleration system** - New system that:
   - Exponentially increases speed each frame
   - Caps speed at max_speed
   - Updates velocity based on current speed
6. **Added system to update loop** - rocket_acceleration_system added to main.rs

### Result:
Projectiles now behave as rockets that start very slowly (50 units/sec) and accelerate exponentially to a maximum speed of 800 units/sec, with no gravity affecting them in the top-down view.
