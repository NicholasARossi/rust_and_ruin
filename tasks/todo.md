## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-27)

### Changes made to implement rocket-style projectiles:

1. **Updated CLAUDE.md** - Clarified that this is a top-down 2D RTS game
2. **Fixed gravity** - Changed gravity from Vec2::new(0.0, -500.0) to Vec2::ZERO in main.rs for proper top-down gameplay
3. **Added Rocket component** - New component in components.rs with:
   - initial_speed: Starting speed of rocket (50.0)
   - max_speed: Maximum speed (800.0)
   - acceleration_rate: Exponential growth rate (2.5)
   - current_speed: Tracks current velocity
   - direction: Normalized direction vector
4. **Updated projectile spawning** - Modified spawn_projectile_system to:
   - Remove GravityScale component
   - Add Rocket component
   - Set initial velocity to 50.0 (slow start)
   - Changed color to orange for rockets
5. **Created rocket acceleration system** - New system that:
   - Exponentially increases speed each frame
   - Caps speed at max_speed
   - Updates velocity based on current speed
6. **Added system to update loop** - rocket_acceleration_system added to main.rs

### Result:
Projectiles now behave as rockets that start very slowly (50 units/sec) and accelerate exponentially to a maximum speed of 800 units/sec, with no gravity affecting them in the top-down view.

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-28) - Total Annihilation Camera Implementation

### Camera Transformation to Orthographic 3D View:

1. **Created camera module** (`src/camera/mod.rs`):
   - Implemented fixed 63.435¬∞ camera angle (Total Annihilation style)
   - Added orthographic projection setup
   - Created coordinate transformation functions for screen/world conversion
   - Added directional lighting for depth perception

2. **Created rendering module** (`src/rendering/mod.rs`):
   - Built sprite mesh creation for flat quads on XZ plane
   - Added material creation with unlit rendering for 2D appearance
   - Ensured proper depth ordering

3. **Updated all systems for 3D**:
   - **Main setup**: Converted from Camera2dBundle to Camera3dBundle with orthographic projection
   - **Entities**: Changed from SpriteBundle to PbrBundle with flat meshes
   - **Movement**: Updated to work on XZ plane (Y=0)
   - **Mouse input**: Implemented 3D ray casting to project clicks onto game plane
   - **Projectiles**: Converted to 3D rendering while maintaining 2D physics

4. **Coordinate system changes**:
   - Game logic operates on XZ plane (horizontal)
   - Y axis represents height (always 0 for game entities)
   - Physics remains 2D but mapped to XZ coordinates

5. **Visual improvements**:
   - Added directional lighting for better depth perception
   - Adjusted entity scales for proper appearance in 3D
   - Maintained pixel-perfect appearance with unlit materials

6. **Testing infrastructure**:
   - Created unit tests for camera transformations
   - Added integration tests for game systems
   - Verified mouse input and movement work correctly

### Technical specifications:
- Camera angle: 63.435¬∞ from horizontal (26.565¬∞ from vertical)
- Orthographic scale: 0.01 for proper zoom level
- All game entities render at Y=0 on the XZ plane
- Physics simulation unchanged (Rapier2D working on XZ plane)

### Result:
Successfully transformed the game from top-down 2D to Total Annihilation-style orthographic 3D view while maintaining all existing gameplay mechanics. The game now has the classic RTS camera angle with proper depth perception and lighting.

## üìù Review of Changes (2025-07-28) - Turret Facing Fix

### Issue: 
After attacking, tank turrets were not facing their targets correctly - they were 90 degrees off.

### Root Cause:
The `calculate_turret_angle` function was using the wrong atan2 parameter order. It was using `direction.y.atan2(direction.x)` which is standard for 2D math where 0¬∞ = right, but Bevy's 3D coordinate system expects `direction.x.atan2(direction.y)` where 0¬∞ = forward (+Z).

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed angle calculation** (`src/systems/turret_control.rs`):
   - Changed from `direction.y.atan2(direction.x)` to `direction.x.atan2(direction.y)`
   - This aligns with Bevy's coordinate system where:
     - 0¬∞ = forward (+Z)
     - 90¬∞ = right (+X)
     - 180¬∞ = backward (-Z)
     - 270¬∞ = left (-X)

2. **Created comprehensive tests** (`tests/turret_facing_tests.rs`):
   - `test_turret_faces_enemy_correctly`: Verifies turret faces enemy using dot product
   - `test_turret_rotation_for_all_directions`: Tests cardinal directions
   - `test_turret_forward_direction_calculation`: Validates rotation math

3. **Verified consistency**:
   - Tank movement system uses the same angle calculation
   - Both systems now use consistent coordinate system
   - All existing tests continue to pass

### Result:
Turrets now correctly face their targets after receiving an attack order. The fix ensures consistent angle calculations throughout the codebase, with both tank body rotation and turret rotation using the same coordinate system conventions.
