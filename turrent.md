observations:
1. Turret does not turn torward target after pressing q (it should be loclocke on, don't worry about projectile firing this should work first)

Create a test where our after targeting we can move the tank around anywhere ad our turret never leaves the target - so our angle calculation always shows it's pointing towards it

This should be a runable demo, and a rust test. essentially showing that body chassi and upper are moving independently
